# Machine Learning Libraries Tutorial

This repository contains comprehensive tutorials for essential Python libraries used in Machine Learning and Data Science. Each library has its own dedicated folder with structured notebooks that explain concepts alongside practical code examples.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate folders for each library to help with performance, handling issues, and to allow focusing on one library at a time:

- **NumPy**: Foundation for scientific computing in Python with powerful N-dimensional array objects
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library with DataFrame and Series data structures
- **Matplotlib**: Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- **SciPy**: Library for scientific and technical computing with modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, and more
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library with simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling

## How to Use This Tutorial

Each library folder contains a Jupyter notebook that follows a consistent structure:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the library and its importance in the ML/Data Science ecosystem
2. **Why Use This Library**: Key advantages and use cases
3. **Core Concepts**: Detailed explanations of fundamental concepts with examples
4. **Advanced Topics**: More complex features and techniques
5. **Real-world Applications**: Practical examples showing how the library is used in machine learning projects
6. **Practice Problems**: Exercises to test your understanding
7. **Resources**: Links to official documentation, GitHub repositories, and additional learning materials
